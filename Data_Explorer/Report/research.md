## üü® **Relevant If You Have Room (Supportive or Specialized)**

These are useful for specific applications or skill enhancement but secondary to your core focus:

| Course Code  | Course Title                                  | Notes                                                                                                          |
| ------------ | --------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **CIV1175H** | Design of Tubular Steel Structures            | Relevant for poles, towers, pipe racks‚Äîcommon in infrastructure.                                               |
| **CIV1167H** | Advanced Structural Dynamics                  | Strong follow-up to CIV515H if you're aiming for deep dynamic modeling (e.g., vibration-sensitive structures). |
| **CIV1169H** | Advanced Topics in Building Design            | More building-focused, but useful if you're working with high-rise urban infrastructure.                       |
| **MIE1804H** | Finite Element Analysis in Engineering Design | Mechanical complement to CIV1174H; good if you're interested in cross-disciplinary modeling.                   |
| **CIV1499H** | Geotechnical Earthquake Engineering           | Optional but valuable if you want to understand soil-structure interaction deeply.                             |
| **MIE1303H** | Fracture Mechanics                            | Specialized‚Äîvaluable only if you're interested in material failure or forensic engineering.                    |
| **CIV544H1** | Design of Timber Structures                   | Less common in infrastructure, but valuable for mass timber public projects (e.g., green bridges).             |

## ‚ùå **Skip or Low Priority (Less Relevant or Redundant)**

These are either redundant with your experience or not aligned with infrastructure projects:

| Course Code  | Course Title                        | Why to Skip                                                                              |
| ------------ | ----------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **CIV510H1** | Solid Mechanics II                  | Likely already covered in undergrad; limited value added for your experience level.      |
| **CIV514H1** | Concrete Technology                 | Focuses on materials and mixing‚Äînot structural design.                                   |
| **CIV519H1** | Structural Analysis II              | Redundant if you‚Äôve already taken advanced structural analysis or are doing CIV1174H.    |
| **CIV515H1** | Introduction to Structural Dynamics | Take **only if you haven‚Äôt covered dynamics** before. Otherwise go straight to CIV1167H. |
